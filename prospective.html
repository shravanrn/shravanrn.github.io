		<p><b>PhD program applicants</b>: Our lab is looking for candidates
		with interest and experience in security, programming languages, or
		architecture. The application form is available at the <a
		href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate/prospective-students/apply">UT
		Austin website</a>. You are also welcome to email me if you have
		questions.
		</p>
		<p><b>Current Masters/Undergrad at UT Austin</b>: If you are a current
		student at UT Austin, I am happy to discuss research projects you can
		try out or participate in. I generally recommend you do this with a
		lighter course load, as research projects tend to eat up a lot of time.
		Please email me to setup a meeting.
		</p>
		<p><b>Masters/Undergrad program applicants</b>: If you are interested in
		applying to the UT Austin masters/undergrad program, please note all
		applications go through a central committee, over which I have no
		control, so you do not have to email me. You are welcome to list me as
		faculty you would like to work with in your application/SOP. After you
		start the program, feel free to send me an email to setup an
		appointment if you want to chat about research.</p>
		<p><b>Current Masters/Undergrad at other universities</b>: If you are not a
		student at UT Austin and are interested in working with me, please note
		our lab does not offer any remote or short-term internships. Instead, I
		would suggest considering applying to the graduate program at UT Austin.
		</p>
		<p><b>Postdoc program applicants</b>: At this time, our lab does not
		have any positions open for Postdocs. This may change in the future, and
		I will do my best to keep this page updated. If you see that this page's
		last updated date has not been updated in over 6 months, feel free to
		email me to inquire if things have changed.
