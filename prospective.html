		<p><b>PhD program applicants</b>: Our lab is looking for candidates
		with interest and experience in security, programming languages, or
		architecture. The application form is available at the <a
		href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate/prospective-students/apply">UT
		Austin website</a>. You are also welcome to email me if you have
		questions.
		</p>
		<p><b>Current Masters/Undergrad (UT Austin)</b>: If you are a current
		student at UT Austin, I am happy to discuss research projects you can
		try out or participate in. I generally recommend you do this with a
		lighter course load, as research projects tend to eat up a lot of time.
		Please email me to setup a meeting.
		</p>
		<p><b>Masters program applicants</b>: If you are interested in
		applying to the UT Austin master's program, please note all applications
		go through a central committee, over which I have no control, so you do
		not have to email me. You are welcome to list me as faculty you would
		like to work with in your application. After you start the program, feel
		free to send me an amil to setup an appointment.</p>
		<p><b>Current Masters/Undergrad (Not at UT Austin)</b>: If you are not a
		student at UT Austin and are interested in working with me, please note
		our lab does not offer any remote or short-term internships. Instead, I
		would suggest considering applying to the graduate program at UT Austin.
		</p>
		<p><b>PostDoc program applicants</b>: At this time, our lab does not
		have an positions open for PostDocs. This may change in the future, and
		I will do my best to keep this page updated. If you see that this page's
		last updated date has not been updated recently, feel free to email me
		to inquire if things have changed.
